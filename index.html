    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">When delivering websites to customers it's important to keep security in mind.<br><br>
      Here are a few tips:
      <br><br>
      <strong>1: Always use SSL</strong>
      <br>
      SSL stands for Security Sockey Layer. SSL secures the information from being tampered with between the server and the user. Users can verify that our website is safe by looking for a lock in the address bar.
      <br><br>
      SSL also makes websites rank better in search engines.
      <br><br>
      <strong>2: Block SQL injections</strong>
      <br>
      Attackers can gain access to our website by manipulating our SQL databases by taking advantage of URL parameters. To prevent these injections we have to parameterize our querys in the database.
      <br><br>
      SQL injections attack the website or application running on our server.
      <br><br>
      <strong>3: Beware of cross-site scripting</strong>
      <br>
      Cross-site scripting, or XSS, can be injected into input forms, cookies, search fields, comments etc.. By taking advantage of these input fields attackers can get access to personal information like card numbers and passwords.
      <br><br>
      XSS attacks target the user of our website.
      <br><br>
      <strong>4: Watch out for cross-site request forgery</strong>
      <br>
      Cross-site request forgery, or CSRF, happen when attackers create malicious links that can be executed without the users knowledge. It is necessary to take security measures that detects unauthorized requests.
      <br><br>
      <strong>5: Only use known third party applications</strong>
      <br>
      Websites today are often built on frameworks and third party plugins and applications. To make sure our website is secure we should only implement third party applications that are widely tested and well known.</p>
