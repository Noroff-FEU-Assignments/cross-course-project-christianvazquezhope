# Cross-Cource Project â€“ HTML and CSS

## Description

This is a website for the rain jacket brand Rainydays. The site is built as a webshop with the purpose of displaying products and let users buy them.

Features I would like to implement in the future include, but are not limited to:

- Activate the product size and color choices
- Implement a functioning cart and checkout
- Create a "My account" page where users can edit their info and see orders

## Built With

The website is built with clean HTML, CSS and vanilla JS.
